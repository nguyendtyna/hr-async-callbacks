 * you choose to attempt the extra practice material, navigate to "callbackReviewSpec.js" and remove the "x" from each "it" within the describe block.
 *
 * example:
 *
 * xit("should be a function", () => {
 *     expect(arraySummer).to.be.a("function");
 *   });
 *
 *   should look like this:
 *
 *  it("should be a function", () => {
